 analyze Question 1 Find the company from each sector that has the largest employee size.

 Find the compnay from each sector that has the largest employee size.
	8 different sectors
				Software Infrastructure, Software Application, Semiconductors, IT Service, Electronic Components, Consumer Electronics, Computer Hardware, Computer Equipments
Expected Values        221000               1541000					 131900     345000          19300					164000				133000				83300
					Microsoft				Amazon					Intel		IBM			    Roper					Apple				Dell				Cisco

+Create struct of sector infomation
	+Create a vector<typestruct> with each index corresponding to a unique sector name
	+fill vector and struct

+Find company in each sector with the most employees
+Find sector with the most employees, and how many employees are in that sector
+Find the sector that has the most compnaies working in it

	+They are the same sector Software Application

Analyze Question 2 Sum the income tax generated by each sector. Show the company from each sector that paid the highest ratio of income tax divided by revenue.

+add the income tax paid in each sector, ignoring any companies that paid negative income tax.
+create negative income tax vector and fill
	+should have Amazon, IBM, Intel, Uber, AMD, Block (Order does not matter here)
+find the company from each sector with the HIGHEST ratio of incometax/rev
	+create a index vector to find the companies index in of vector of structs
+find the company from each sector with the LOWEST ratio of tax/rev
	+create a index vector to find the companies index in of vector of structs
+find the average ratio of tax / rev for all companies
	+use avg ratio to suggest what companies who paid negative tax should have paid 
	
	+test cases: avg ratio * annualRev = Should Have paid tax
	avg ratio is .027 or 2.7%
	amazaon 513.98 * .027	IBM 60.52 * .027	Intel 63.05 * .027		Uber 31.87 * .027	AMD 23.6*.027		Block 17.53 *.027
	13.877					1.63404					1.70					0.86			  0.637					0.473
	Amazone of by .05
	use full digit calculations and get right answer
	513.97998 * .0270832181
	+13.92		+good calculations

	
	Analyze Question 3 Find the company from each sector with the highest ratio of Annual Revenue divided Market Cap

	+find highest ratio of Annual Rev divided by market cap

	test case: only 1 company should have a ratio greater then 100% which is Dell
		dell revenue is 102.3 billion and the market cap is .028 trillion or 28 billion
		102.3 / 28 = 3.6535 * 100 is 365.35%
